Domain Name System (DNS): DNS is like the phone book of the internet. Instead of remembering IP addresses (which are numerical and not user-friendly), we use domain names (like www.example.com) to access websites.


DNS translates these human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to locate each other on the internet.
